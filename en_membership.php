                                        submit a successful payment, the points will be automatically credited and
                                        recorded in your spending account.</p>
                                    <p>Royal Cheese Online Shop members can earn points through the following ways:</p>

                                    <p>(ii) Online Shop Spending - Earn 1 point for every $1 you spend on orders/classes
                                        in the Online Shop. Points will be rounded down to the nearest single digit,
                                        e.g. if the net purchase is HK$99.5 after the discount, the customer will earn
                                        99 points</p>

                                        friend's first purchase in the Online Shop.</p>
